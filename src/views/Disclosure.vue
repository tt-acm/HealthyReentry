            At Thornton Tomasetti, our first priority – now and always – is the health and safety of our employees. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The COVID-19 outbreak has challenged us to find creative ways to best protect our employees.
            <br>
            <br>
            We respect your privacy. As we continue to monitor COVID-19 and its impact on our people and offices, it is important that designated members of our Talent Team are aware of COVID-19 related cases at our firm. To protect all of our employees, the Healthy Reentry application will allow you to securely and confidentially record:
          </p>
          <ol class="text-muted mb-2 pl-3">
            <li>your personal COVID-19 status through a series of colors (green, orange and red).</li>
            <li>your in-person interactions with fellow employees at work and/or during work events that do not adhere to the firm’s guidance on social distancing.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="mb-2">
            We ask that you share your COVID-19 health status and potential exposures with designated members of our Talent Team so we can continue to make decisions based on what is best for all employees’ safety and our business. The information will <b>ONLY</b> be viewed Dan Stauthamer (Chief Human Resources Officer), Sarina Singh (Senior Talent Partner) and Gwendolyn Dowdy (Senior Talent Operations Coordinator).
